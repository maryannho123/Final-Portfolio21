            <h3>SEPP Internship</h3>
            <p>
                This past summer I worked in Portland, OR at Collins Aerospace.
                I evaluated performance characteristics of proprietary and competitor airborne radars for use in autonomous airway landing in low visibility conditions
                I also diagnosed and resolved electrical issues that interfered with the performance of radars during live test in the air. 
                I implemented radar data collection and processing in MatLab to extract detected objects from airborne radars in various testing environments
            </p>
            <h3> CU Internship</h3>
            <p>
                I aanalyzed ten years worth of sodium lidar measurements through MatLab to characterize sodium photon counts, wind, and temperature in the atmosphere
                I developed LabVIEW tutorials and technical reports for data acquisition systems in order to update and optimize the system
                I conducted alignment procedures for Coherent 899-21 Ring Dye Laser and various optic measurements using fiber cables to train graduate students
