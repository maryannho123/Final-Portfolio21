            <p> Hi, my name is Mary. I grew up with my four siblings and a very loud pet bird in Boulder
                Colorado. From growing up right next to the flatirons, I am an avid hiker and skiier. 
                My childhoods consisted on camping in the Rockies and family bike rides along the Colorado River.
                Music is a big part of my life as I actively played the violin for 15 years</p>
            <p> I am currently a Junior majoring in Computer Science through the 
                College of Enginnering. I have experience in machine learning, computer vision, data processing, and research.
                I am actively engaged in the Society of Women of Engineers as I am one of the girl scout outreach officers. One of my passions
                is increasing accesibbility of STEM opportunities to young girls. </p>
            <p> Outside of school, I am an avid watcher of Bachelor Nation, I love baking, and traveling.  </p>
