            <h2>Relevant Projects</h3>
            <h3>EECS 280</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                   I wrote a simulator for a game of Euchre. I gained experience with abstract data types, object-oriented programming, and polymorphism.
                </li>
                <li>In this project, I wrote a program that uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automatically identify 
                    the subject of posts from the EECS 280 Piazza. I gained experience with recursion, binary trees, templates, comparators, and the map data structure.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>EECS 281</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I implemented a stock market simulation. I utilized the "streaming algorithm" in order
                    to determine the optimal point to buy or sell to reach highest profit margin </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>EECS 370</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Project One: I wrote program to take an assembly-language program and produced the corresponding machine language. 
                    In the second part, I wrote behavioral simulator for the resulting machine code. 
                    In the third part, I wrote a short assembly-language program to multiply two numbers.
                </li>
                <li>Project Two: In the first part, I wrote a program that assembles an assembly file into an object file. 
                    In the second, I wrote a program to link object files into one executable consisting of machine code. 
                    In the third, I wrote an assembly-language function to recursively compute combination(n,r) 
                </li>
                <li>Project Three: I wrote a cycle-accurate behavioral simulator for a pipelined implementation 
                    of the LC-2K, complete with data forwarding and simple branch prediction.
                </li>
                <li>Project Four: I wrote program to take an assembly-language program and produced the corresponding machine language. 
                    In the second part, I wrote behavioral simulator for the resulting machine code. 
                    In the third part, I wrote a short assembly-language program to multiply two numbers.
